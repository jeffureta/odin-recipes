        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef.<br> 
            Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.<br> 
            Drain and discard any excess grease.<br> 
            Add water and taco seasoning.<br> 
            Cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish.<br>
            Spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer.<br>
            Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer.<br>
            Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese.<br>
            Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce.<br>
            Sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.<br> 
            Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.<br> 
            Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.<br>
            Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn on oven's broiler.
        </li>
        <li>
